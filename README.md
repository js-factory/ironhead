Ironhead 
======
NodeJS Framework over [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) based on functional and declarative programming.


# Motivation

> In typical fast pace dev environment, code review is a challenge and simply causes more and more tech debt. Functional Programming enables developers to refactor a simple program or function. Taking control over execution reduces repetitive work to be done by programmer and eventually help in reducing number of lines of code to be written.


#### Key features
1. Code decoupling.
2. Functional programming.
3. Clear boundries between presentation and business logic.
4. Declarative program.
5. Refactoring smaller functions are much more easy.


#### MVC
> MVC pattern has severed us exceptionally well over the period and still does. But it's no more fit for our next generation UI framework.
